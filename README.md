# 💖 Yes or No Interactive Page

A fun and responsive web project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — where the **"No" button keeps running away** when you try to click it 😆.  
It includes colorful particle animations, hover/click effects, and a beautiful gradient theme.

## ✨ Features

- 🌀 **Interactive Buttons** — The "No" button escapes your cursor when hovered or clicked (depending on device).
- 💥 **Animated Particles** — Smooth particle burst animations for visual fun.
- 🌈 **Dark Gradient Theme** — Modern neon-inspired dark mode UI.
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** — Works perfectly on both desktop and mobile screens.
- ⚡ **Smooth Transitions** — CSS transitions and keyframes for a clean motion effect.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Page structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling, responsiveness, and animations  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Button movement and logic  

---

## 🧩 How It Works

- On **desktop**, the “No” button moves away when you hover over it.  
- On **mobile**, the button moves when you tap it (no hover events).  
- Uses random position generation for movement while keeping it within screen bounds.  
- Particle elements are animated using `@keyframes` and custom CSS variables.

## 📱 Responsiveness

- Adjusts layout and element sizes using `@media` queries.  
- Works across all modern browsers and devices.
